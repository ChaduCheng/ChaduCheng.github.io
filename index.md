## About Me

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Guangzhou. Prior to joining HKUST, I pursued my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston.
I obtained my master and bachelor degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University and Hebei University of Technology.

Other than my work, I am a big fan of the Golden State Warriors. My favorite basketball player is Steph Curry. Go Warriors!

## Research Interests

I am interested in trustworthy, efficient AI. My current research primarily focuses on ensuring the trustworthiness, robustness, and efficiency of various AI models, which is including:

- **Generative AI:** Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Large Audio Language Models
- **Embodied AI:** Vision Language Action Models
