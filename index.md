## About Me

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Guangzhou. I am interested in trustworthy and efficient AI. My current research primarily focuses on ensuring the trustworthiness, robustness, and efficiency of various AI models, including:

- **Generative AI:**  Large Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models (Large Vision Language Models, Large Audio Language Models), Diffusion Models; 
- **Embodied AI:** Vision Language Action Models, Imitation Learning, Humanoid Robot;
- **Discriminative AI:** Convolutional Neural Network, Vision Transformer, Spiking Neural Network.
